# Exersite

*Exersite* is my own little pet project to build up a bit more of a portfolio whilst also inspiring me to exercise more. People can visit the site and redeem points to make me do exercise!

I've been exercising decently but I have noticed that I can struggle a little with the motivation. Honestly I don't think this site is gonna fix much regarding my exercising schedule but it's at least a fun project to work on!
